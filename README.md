## 🧱 BEM Naming Convention

I followed the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to write maintainable and scalable CSS. Example:

```html
<div class="course-card">
  <div class="course-card__image"></div>
  <div class="course-card__title">...</div>
  <div class="course-card__price course-card__price--discounted"></div>
</div>
